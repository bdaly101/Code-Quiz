#Code Quiz

##Description

I built a coding quiz game that displays a quiz of five questions with four possible choices each. The quiz is timed and every wrong answer resultts in a time deduction. At the end of the quiz the user is able to enter their initials for them to be saved in the Lead Score page which can be accessed from the home menu. To build this project I used Javascript, HTML, CSS and JQuery. I built this project to get more experience using jquery and javascript to store varialbles and update a display.
